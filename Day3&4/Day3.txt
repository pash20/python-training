Agenda Day 3:
- Quick Recap
- Remaining Basic Python Stuff
- Python - ML/DS Libraries
          - Numpy
          - Pandas
          - Matplotlib
          - Scikitlearn
-------------------------------------------
Remaining Basic Python Stuff
 1. OOPS 
- Object have
      - attribute (variables)
      - behaviour (function)

Example
  An object of Dog
    -  attribute (color, weight)
    -  behaviour  (bark())

WHat is a Class?
Objects are created from class. Class is like a template/defination which
tells what kind of object your are creating.


We create object from a class

ob1 = Employee()
ob1 = Employee()

2. Exception Handling
3. Regular Expression (search

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DS/ML libraries in Python
1. Numpy 
     - is a n-dim array 
         1d -> Vector
         2d -> Matrix
         3d -> 3 d array
 - used for maths related operation

   How to create a numpy array
- We create it from a list np.array(my_list)

In-built Numpy Functions
arange(), linspace(), randn(), rand(), randInt(), reshape(), zeros(), ones()

In-built Numpy Attributes
__version__

Selection of elements in Numpy

Statistics
- Range   (Min, Max)
- Standard Deviation (how much data is away from center/spread)
- Variance (how much data is away from center/spread)

SD is the square root of Variance
